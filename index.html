		“When I turned 23, I had just graduated college with a terrible GPA as a result of what felt like endless years of part-time work, classes I was way underqualified for, and relationships that never lasted more than two months. I was sure at that point that I could do no better with my life and that my only hope was to give up. But then I discovered Life Exchange, and now, I don’t have to worry anymore! My life is now someone else’s problem!”  -- [Some random name]
		</p>
		<p class="testimonials">
		“I used to think my life was boring, but once I joined Life Exchange, and took the life of [some cool name], I never looked back! I suddenly became a [something] with three kids and a wife. I would’ve never had such a life without Life Exchange.” -- [Idk]
		</p>
		<p class="testimonials">
		“Being a [something] was cool at first, but when my wife and three kids started getting on my nerves about using all my money to buy them clothes or jewelry or ponies, I just got tired of it all. So I posted my life to Life Exchange! Now some poor sucker has my old life and I get to finally live out my dream of being a nobody! Thanks, Life Exchange!” -- [someone else]
